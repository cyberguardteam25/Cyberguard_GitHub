## 🧠 Tech Stack

**Frontend** (Android):
- Kotlin & XML
- Retrofit for API communication
- CameraX for QR scanning
- ConstraintLayout, CardView, and custom UI components

**Backend**:
- Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- Machine Learning for malware & phishing detection
- MariaDB/MySQL database (hosted on Kali Linux or server)
- Ngrok for testing local APIs

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberguardteam25/Cyberguard.git

- Add your backend URL in the Retrofit interface files (ApiClient.kt)
- Run the app on Android 8.0+ or emulator
- now u r able check the CyberGuard in Android Studio directly

3. Backend Setup (u need to access the backend code in able to set up the whole backend)
- Setup Python environment (for the backed up code)
- Run Flask/FastAPI server
- Use Ngrok to expose your local backend if needed
- MariaDB (for storing CyberGuard stuff, e.g. users emails)
